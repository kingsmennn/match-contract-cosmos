# Match Cosmos Marketplace Contract

This is a CosmWasm-based smart contract for creating and managing a decentralized marketplace. Buyers and sellers can interact via requests and offers to exchange goods or services securely.

## Features

- **User Profiles**: Register, update, and manage user profiles.
- **Store Creation**: Sellers can create stores for buyers to browse.
- **Requests & Offers**: Buyers can create requests, and sellers can respond with offers.
- **Offer Acceptance**: Buyers can accept offers and proceed with transactions.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Requests and offers follow a lifecycle (Pending, Accepted, Locked, Completed).

## Contract Architecture

### State Variables

- **`User`**: Stores user details like username, phone number, account type (Buyer/Seller), and location.
- **`Store`**: Represents a sellerâ€™s store.
- **`Request`**: Represents a product or service request from a buyer.
- **`Offer`**: Represents an offer from a seller in response to a buyer's request.

### Execute Messages (`ExecuteMsg`)

- `CreateUser`: Register a user with details like username, phone, and account type.
- `UpdateUser`: Update user profile information.
- `CreateStore`: Sellers create a store with details like name, description, and location.
- `CreateRequest`: Buyers create a request for goods or services.
- `CreateOffer`: Sellers respond to requests with offers.
- `AcceptOffer`: Buyers accept offers to lock the request.
- `DeleteRequest`: Buyers delete their pending requests.
- `ToggleLocation`: Enable or disable location tracking.
- `MarkRequestAsCompleted`: Confirm request completion by the buyer.

### Query Messages (`QueryMsg`)

- `GetUser`: Retrieve user information by address.
- `GetRequest`: Get details of a specific request.
- `GetAllRequests`: Fetch all marketplace requests.
- `GetOffer`: Get details of a specific offer.
- `GetOffersByRequest`: Get all offers for a specific request.
- `GetUserStores`: Get all stores created by a user.
- `GetSellerOffers`: Fetch all offers made by a seller.

## State Counters

- **`USER_COUNT`**: Tracks the total number of users.
- **`STORE_COUNT`**: Tracks the number of stores.
- **`REQUEST_COUNT`**: Tracks the number of requests.
- **`OFFER_COUNT`**: Tracks the number of offers.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to build, test, and deploy the CosmWasm contract.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- CosmWasm CLI tools (`osmosisd`, `wasmcli`) [osmosisd](https://docs.osmosis.zone/cosmwasm/testnet/cosmwasm-deployment/)

### 1. Install Rust and Set the Default Toolchain

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup update stable
```

### 2. Add WASM Compilation Target

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### 3. Install Required Cargo Packages

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

### 4. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingsmennn/match-contract-cosmos
cd match-contract-cosmos
```

### 5. Build the Contract

```bash
cargo wasm
`optional (optimize)`
sudo docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
    --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
    --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
    cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.6
```

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

---

## Deployment

To deploy the contract on a CosmWasm-compatible blockchain (e.g., osmosisd):

### 1. Store the Contract on the Blockchain

```bash
RES=$(osmosisd tx wasm store artifacts/match_cosmos_contract.wasm --from wallet --gas-prices 0.1uosmo --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --output json -b block --chain-id osmo-test-5 \
    --node https://rpc.testnet.osmosis.zone:443)
```

### 2. Install JQ (Optional for JSON Processing)

- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install jq
  ```
- **Mac**:
  ```bash
  brew install jq
  ```

### 3. Get the Contract Code ID

```bash
CODE_ID=$(echo $RES | jq -r '.logs[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value')
```

### 4. Instantiate the Contract

Initialize the contract with the desired state:

```bash
INIT='{}'
```

Instantiate the contract:

```bash
osmosisd tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" \
    --from wallet --label "my first contract" --gas-prices 0.025uosmo --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block -y --no-admin --chain-id osmo-test-5 \
    --node https://rpc.testnet.osmosis.zone:443
```

### 5. Get the Contract Address

```bash
CONTRACT_ADDR=$(osmosisd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --output json --node https://rpc.testnet.osmosis.zone:443 --chain-id osmo-test-5 | jq -r '.contracts[0]')
```

---

## Error Handling

The contract uses custom error types for handling exceptions, such as:

- `MarketplaceError::OnlySellersAllowed`: Triggered when a non-seller performs seller-only actions.
- `MarketplaceError::OfferAlreadyAccepted`: Triggered when a buyer tries to accept an already accepted offer.
- `MarketplaceError::UnauthorizedBuyer`: Triggered when a user tries to delete someone else's request.
